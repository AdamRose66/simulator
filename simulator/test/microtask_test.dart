// These tests show the difference between a [Simulator] and the native Dart
// scheduler, when it comes to the timing of microtasks.
//
// The [Simulator] 'saves up' all the microtasks until the end of the delta,
// while the native scheduler executes them between successive timers in the
// same delta.
//
// Or more precisely, the Dart scheduler has no concept of a delta so it
// schedules a microtask before the next timer, even if the next timer was
// previously scheduled to occur at the same time as the currently executing
// timer.
